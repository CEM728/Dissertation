-19.91+.159i : Best figure so far yet. 2deg_fem_8THz_5nm_final
	       Lc = .1 um
	       t = 5 nm

Try:

-27 + .8i    :t = 1 nm : FAIL

5 THz, 5 nm, -3.023 + .4473i

This is a good value for -.42+.0046i for length assumed 3 nm in thicnkess 

For a different scattering time (defined by tau = 1 ps) -.42 + .2649i
