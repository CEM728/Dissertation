\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{CONTRIBUTORS AND FUNDING SOURCES}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesn't add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.


\subsection*{Contributors}

The majority of the chapter on Optical Antennas (Chapter II) was written by Dr Robert Nevels.

The transmission-line network technique for multilayer structures discussed in Chapter III is attributed to Dr Krzysztof Michalski of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.

The concept of Chapter V was suggested by Dr Suhail Zubairy of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Ideas related to imaging and optics were generated through discussions with Xiaodong Zeng from the Department of Physics and Astronomy who also contributed in the writing part.

All other work conducted for the dissertation was completed by the student independently.

\subsection*{Funding Sources}
This graduate study was supported by the Fulbright Program.
