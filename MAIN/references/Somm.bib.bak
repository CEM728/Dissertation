  abstract = {Sommerfeld-integrals (SIs) are ubiquitous in the analysis of problems involving antennas and scatterers embedded in planar multilayered media. It is well known that the oscillating and slowly decaying nature of their integrands makes the numerical evaluation of the SI real-axis tail segment a very time consuming and computationally expensive task. Therefore, SI tails have to be specially treated. In this paper we compare two recently developed techniques for their efficient numerical evaluation. First, a partition-extrapolation method, in which the integration-then-summation procedure is combined with a new version of the weighted averages (WA) extrapolation technique, is summarized. The previous variants of WA technique are also discussed. Then, a review of double-exponential (DE) quadrature formulas for direct integration of the SI tails is presented. The efficient way of implementing the algorithms, their pros and cons, as well as comparisons of their performance are discussed in detail.},

The solution of plane wave reflection and transmission is presented, and surface wave propagation along graphene is studied via the poles of the Sommerfeld integrals. For isolated graphene characterized by complex surface conductivity = Ј + j, a proper transverse-electric surface wave exists if and only if 0 ͑associated with interband conductivity, and a proper transverse-magnetic surface wave exists for associated with intraband conductivity. By tuning the chemical potential at infrared frequencies, the sign of can be varied, allowing for some control over surface wave properties.},

  abstract  = {The classical Sommerfeld half-space problem is revisited, with generalizations to multilayer and plasmonic media and focus on the surface field computation. A new ab initio solution is presented for an arbitrarily oriented Hertzian dipole radiating in the presence of a material half-space with arbitrary horizontal stratification. The solution method combines the vector potential approach and the spectral domain transmission line analog of the medium, which results in the most compact formulation and facilitates the inclusion of any number of layers in the analysis. Following Sommerfeld, the solution is first expressed in terms of the Fourier–Bessel transforms, also known as Sommerfeld integrals. Analytical properties of the integrands in the complex plane are then investigated, including the location of the Sommerfeld pole, which gives rise to the Zenneck wave (ZW) or surface plasmon polariton (SPP), and alternative field representations are developed by a deformation of the integration path and analytic continuation of the integrand functions, using hyperbolic and vertical branch cuts. Closed-form expressions for the asymptotic surface fields are also derived and the r{\^{o}}le of the ZWand SPP is elucidated. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the theory, from radio frequencies to visible light.},

  abstract = {A review is presented of the extrapolation methods for accelerating the convergence of Sommerfeld-type integrals (i.e. semi-infinite range integrals with Bessel function kernels), which arise in problems involving antennas or scatterers embedded in planar multilayered media. Attention is limited to partition-extrapolation procedures in which the Sommerfeld integral is evaluated as a sum of a series of partial integrals over finite subintervals and is accelerated by an extrapolation method applied over the real-axis tail segment ($\alpha$,∞) of the integration path, where $\alpha$>0 is selected to ensure that the integrand is well behaved. An analytical form of the asymptotic truncation error (or the remainder), which characterizes the convergence properties of the sequence of partial sums and serves as a basis for some of the most efficient extrapolation methods, is derived. Several extrapolation algorithms deemed to be the most suitable for the Sommerfeld integrals are described and their performance is compared. It is demonstrated that the performance of these methods is strongly affected by the horizontal displacement of the source and field points $\rho$ and by the choice of the subinterval break points. Furthermore, it is found that some well-known extrapolation techniques may fail for a number of values of $\rho$ and ways to remedy this are suggested. Finally, the most effective extrapolation methods for accelerating Sommerfeld integral tails are recommended},
