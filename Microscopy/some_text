Plasma wave instability in an ungated field effect transistor

The existence of plasma wave resonance in the channel of a high electron mobility transistor shielded by a metal gate terminal are well-known. When the source terminal is biased in such a way that it acts as a ac short (capacitor) and the drain terminal is ac open (inductor), current starts to flow in the thin electron channel formed due to the two electron gas (2DEG) heterostructure of two partially different semiconductors. The electrons are reflected from the drain terminal due to boundary conditions present. Hence, the channel appears like a thin cavity where the plasma waves emanating due to electron reflections resonate. This resonance may lead to instability of plasma waves upon an increase in the voltage bias which leads to acceleration of the channel electrons ultimately resulting in radiation that is typically found to be in the terahertz frequency range. The function of the gate terminal is to control the electron concentration in the 2DEG channel which decides the resonant frequency of the drifting electrons. In the absence of the gate terminal, the electrons also undergo the same resonant phenomena which was first observed by Dyakonov-Shur [ungated paper]. However, the dispersion relation of the plasma waves in what is called the ungated channel differs from the usual gated region and the resonance frequency for a given dimension is higher.
