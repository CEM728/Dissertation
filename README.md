Horizontal Magnetic Dipole over a lossy half-space

We consider a two-dimensional problem of a magnetic dipole placed along the interface of free-space and lossy dielectric. The Green's function of the problem illustrated in \ref{fig:problem} can be formulated by first expressing the magnetic current as:

\begin{equation}
J\_m = \delta(z)
